# Website design

Some website features and functionality.

## UI Features

- Dark mode
- Font options

## Story features

Users can sort by tags, and titles, usernames and descriptions. Search should attempt to find closest match to what is provided, and exclude anything blacklisted by the user.

## Moderation

Both AO3 and FFN have iffy moderation tools. FFH will seek to change that.

- All comments on an author's work can be removed by the author. A reason must be provided
- Fics/users can be reported for policy violations (pedophilia, harassment, etc.)
- When an account is flagged as spamming too many times, it is put under review
- Block accounts less than a certain age from being able to interact (Avoids spam/harassment)

## Notifications

- Email preferences
- Browser notifications

## Hyperlinks

Hyperlinks can be embedded in stories, in author's notes, in user descriptions, and in PMs. When clicked, they will create a pop-up that asks the user if they are sure they want to follow the link, as it may be malicious.

Recognized links (FFN, AO3, Reddit, Discord, etc) may be exempt from the pop-up.

# Stats design

Stats are very important to some users.

Some commonly accessed stats:
- Unique visitors
- Number of views
- Graph of views over time
- Graph of views over time per chapter
- Indicate what chapter likes/dislikes, comments, etc occur on.

These stats will allow an author to determine what is working, what isn't, and allow them to make choices based off of what makes sense for their stories.

## How stats will be tracked

Unique visitors will be tracked by connection and account.

Views will be tracked by two methods: By user account and by connection made. Several connections within a short timeframe from the same computer will not result in multiple views, so refreshing the page a lot will not boost view counts.

Users will have access to a stats page that will list:
- Views and unique visits per day, week, or month
- Views/unique visits of each individual chapter
- Comments and ratings per chapter

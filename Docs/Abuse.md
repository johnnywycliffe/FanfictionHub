# Abuse descriptions

- Pedophilia: Work glorifies depiction of sex with minors. Note that if the work is condemning the practice and maintains only necessary descriptions or it is only referenced to have happened, this does not necessarily constitute an abuse. However, it must be tagged as such.
- Threats, doxing: Mentioning specific or non-specific threats (Calls to violence, direct mention of causing physical harm, etc.) against a real group or individuals, rascism, sexism, attempting to gaslight or otherwise maliciously manipulate an individual, stating that a real group or individuals should harm or kill themselves, or posting personally identifying information of individuals are not tolerated. Stories may not glorify harassment, threatening, or doxing of real life groups or individuals.
- Spam: Comment, PM, or story is sent unsolicited with the intent to cause harm. Rude language, repeated attempts to engage in a topic despite another user's disinterest, or copy-paste text all fall under this rule. This rule does not apply to constructive criticism unless it is overly harsh.
- Solicitation: Comment, PM or story is asking for money, attempting to sell a product or service, or asking a user to participate in a competition. Asking for comments and likes is also disallowed from PMs and comments, but may be embedded into a fic. 
- Real person fics: Fics should not include real people unless that person can reasonably be considered a public figure. A public figure is a person who is well known in general or well known within a community. A person may indiivdually grant rights to use their likeness, but this permission can be rescinded at any time via report.
- Improper tags: If a fic is not tagged appropriately, it may be automatically tagged or removed from the website. Improper tags include rating, fandom, and trigger warning tags. Improper tags do not include pairings, characters, Genres etc. 
- Other TOS violation: Case by case basis.

Depending on the nature and frequency of abuse, action will be taken as appropriate.

"Glorifying" means to revel in describing and action with unnecessary detail, or attempting to justify it to the reader as less harmfully or even beneficial.

Misreporting abuse will result in losing access to the reporting system, account, or access to the website as a whole.

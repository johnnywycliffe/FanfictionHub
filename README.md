# Fanfiction Hub

A website designed to replace the outdated fanfiction websites that currently exist.

Key aspects:
- Automatic tag generation: Fics attempt to automatically tag themselves, and new tags can easily be generated
- Robust moderation: More control over language and spam, with abuse mitigations
- Easy to use Editor
- Easy image embedding
- Easy to share in-progress works with a beta reader/editor

The website will have a modern, minaalist design to give the text center stage.
